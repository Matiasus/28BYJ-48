# C Library for 28BYJ-48 stepper motor
The main aim of this simple project is verify function of rotary encoder with stepper motor. 

## Stepper motor 28BYJ-48
Detailed information are described in [Datasheet 28BYJ-48](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/stepd-01-data-sheet-1143075.pdf).

## LCD Display
Detailed information are described in [Datasheet SSD1306](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf). The library for driving OLED display should be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Matiasus/SSD1306).
